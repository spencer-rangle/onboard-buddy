    # Getting started checklist
    Below are the 6 main steps you'll go through as you experience your mentorship journey:

    ### 1. Learn about the program
    Review [Session 1: Program Info + Tips] of the [Mentorship onboarding] series for an overview of the program and to assess your readiness to join the next cohort.

    ### 2. Talk to your manager
    Your manager should be in the loop about your intention to participate in the program and what role you want to sign up for (mentor, mentee, or both). They are also a great person to help you identify strengths and opportunities for growth that you might want to focus on through mentorship.

    ### 3. Register
    Registration for the next cohort will be open during the window indicated in the [Peer Mentorship Program Dates]

    ***New participants:*** If you have not yet participated in mentorship using the Together platform, please carve out 10-15 minutes to register [here] You can check out a preview of the registration questionnaire in [Session 1: Program Info + Tips]

    ***Existing participants:*** If you have participated in a program using Together, you will still need to [register] to participate in this specific cohort. That said, your profile should be pre-populated based on your previous answers.

    ðŸš€ Registration for the Q1-2023 cohort is now closed. We'll launch a new cohort in Q2/Q3! Look for an announcement in 

    ### 4. Get paired up
    When registration closes, the system will crunch all the registration data and spit out a list of proposed mentors to all mentees. Mentees are welcome to look beyond this list and browse all available mentors. Mentees will submit their preferences and wait for a match. As preferences are submitted, mentors will begin to receive pairing requests from mentees. Mentors will then confirm who they would like to be paired with.  Confirmed pairs will be notified by email.

    ### 5. Participate in mentorship
    The pairing process will conclude on the date identified in the [Peer Mentorship Program Dates], at which point everyone is welcome to start booking their sessions. You'll receive prompts via email from Together with excellent tips on how to prepare for your sessions as well as ideas on formats you might want to adopt for your sessions. We've also conveniently grouped these here for your reference under [Mentorship Sessions Structure and Formats]

    ### 6. Wrap up and do it all again!
    Pairs will wrap up after about three months. We hope to see you in the next cohort! ðŸ¤©
